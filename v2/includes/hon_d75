    75E Non-GMS: PARISAD_68.xx.xx.xxxx.zip
    License File: lic_75eL0N_1.xml

    Delete CommonES_v3.xx.zip -> IPSM\honeywell\autoinstall\
    Delete folder "persist"   -> IPSM\honeywell\
    Move CommonES_v4.xx.zip   -> IPSM\honeywell\autoinstall\

Troubleshooting "Data Collection has stopped":
 1  On the device, become a developer.
 2  Go to 'Settings' > 'Developer options' > 'Honeywell developer options'
 3  Tap 'Erase the user data/IPSM/OEM partition' and confirm by tapping on 'RESET PHONE'
 4  Created in the IPSM folder a new folder 'honeywell', and in there subfolder 'autoinstall'
 5  Copy again the CommonES V4.xx zip file to the folder 'IPSM\honeywell\autoinstall'
 6  Select the 'Autoinstall' icon and click 'Package Update' to install the new package.
 7  After the device has installed that package and has automatically rebooted, it should be fully functional.
Note: At this moment, it is NOT possible to successfully upgrade the kernel by placing it in the IPSM folder 'honeywell\autoinstall' and perform a regular system update.
It looks to install itself correctly, but in the end the devices will continuously show a 'Data Collection has stopped' notification.</p>
